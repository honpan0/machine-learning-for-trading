`SUPERSEDES_POPULATION` names the population hash this run replaces. A population is the set of
prediction identities, so anything that moves a training identity - a changed epoch schedule as
much as a changed label menu - produces a different set under the same name, and the registry
refuses to write it without being told which snapshot it supersedes. It is empty here because
this notebook, run as it stands, reproduces the members already published under that name rather
than changing them, and reproducing a published list is not a replacement. Fill it in when you
have changed something that moves an identity and want the new set to take the name; the error
raised on the attempt tells you which hash to name. A reduced-scale run passes it empty whatever
the default is: a population produced under a reduction is thrown away with the workspace it was
written to, so it has no lineage to extend.

A second run of this notebook trains nothing. Every identity is re-derived from the inputs, the
registry already holds the matching rows and the saved weights, and the runner returns the stored
result rather than training again - so re-running it unchanged costs the time it takes to read
the data. The latent-factor runner reports no per-fold fitted-or-reused breakdown, unlike the
linear and boosted families, so the counts above are of what the population holds rather than of
what this particular run computed.

### Running configurations of your own

The published run log is read-only. To add runs, open the study against a workspace, which holds
its own registry and artifacts and reads the same labels and features:

```python
study = open_study("etfs", workspace="~/ml4t-experiments")
configs = load_model_configs(study, "latent_factors", labels=["fwd_ret_5d"], config_names=["cae"])
requests = model_requests(study, configs, overrides={"device": "cuda"})
resolved = tuple(request.resolve() for request in requests)
execution, population = run_model_population(study, resolved, population_name="my-cae-v1")
```

To change the architecture or the schedule, edit `case_studies/config/cae/cae.yaml`. That changes
this configuration's identity, so its result registers as a new row beside the old one rather
than replacing it - and that includes `n_epochs` and `checkpoint_interval`, which decide how many
members the population has. Give the run its own `population_name`: a name refers to one set of
members permanently, and reusing it for a different set raises.
[`RUN_LOG.md`](../RUN_LOG.md#running-your-own-configurations) covers the rest.

## 4. What came out

One row per label and epoch checkpoint, read back from the registry. `ic_mean` is the
**information coefficient**: on each validation date, rank the funds by the model's prediction,
rank them by the return they went on to earn, correlate the two rankings, and average that daily
correlation over the validation period.

`ic_n_days` is how many validation dates produced a defined correlation, and it decides which
rows are comparable with each other. A network that has settled into predicting nearly the same
value for every fund on a date gives that date no spread to rank, and the date drops out of the
average - so that checkpoint's `ic_mean` is an average over a different sample from its
neighbours'. `full_coverage` marks the rows measured on every date their own label offers, and
the curves below are restricted to those. **Coverage is judged within a label**, because a
21-day forward return runs out of window earlier than a five-day one and one global maximum would
mark the whole 21-day grid incomplete for a reason that has nothing to do with the models.

The published catalog is checked against the population planned before fitting rather than
against its own row count, because a run that lost a member would otherwise report a shorter
table and nothing else.

### What more training does

Each line traces one label's out-of-sample IC as epochs are added. This is the figure the
checkpoint dimension exists to produce, and it separates two things a single end-of-training
number cannot.

A line that rises and then falls has an interior optimum: the network was still learning, then
began fitting the training window at the expense of the validation folds. A line that wanders
around zero without trend never had anything to learn, and its highest point is wherever the
noise happened to peak. Both produce a respectable-looking maximum, which is why the maximum is
not what a checkpoint is judged on and why all ten are published rather than the best one.

One panel per label, each with its own vertical scale, because a horizon with something to learn
and one without would be averaged into a single indistinct band if they shared axes.
