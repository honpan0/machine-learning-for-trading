# CME futures: regularizing a design matrix built in blocks

The 30 products in this universe are described by 69 features that do not form one
undifferentiated set. They arrive in families. Eleven columns measure **carry** - the return
earned by holding a futures position as it converges towards spot - as a level, a percentile, a
sector-relative rank, a z-score over two windows, and its interaction with momentum. Eight
measure a rolling Sharpe ratio, seven momentum, seven volatility. Within a family the columns
are near-copies of one another by construction; across families they are not.

That block structure changes what a penalty has to do. A design matrix whose columns are all
variations on one signal has a single direction worth keeping, and shrinkage finds it. This one
has several, and the question is whether a penalty strong enough to collapse each family leaves
the differences between families intact. **Regularization** - adding a penalty on coefficient
size to the fitting objective - is the instrument, and how much of it to apply is the experiment
this notebook runs.

The cross-section is also unlike an equity universe. Ranking these products means ranking corn
against ten-year notes against crude, whose returns differ in volatility by an order of
magnitude and whose drivers have little in common. A cross-sectional information coefficient
over that universe is a weaker instrument than one over a set of comparable assets, and the
results below should be read with that in mind.

**Learning objectives.** By the end of this notebook you will be able to:

- Read the set of models a case study has declared for a label, and say which estimator and
  which hyperparameters each declared name resolves to.
- Bind those declarations to the data on disk and check, before anything is fitted, that every
  configuration will be measured on the same products, the same dates and the same folds.
- Fit a population of models on walk-forward folds and publish one complete set of validation
  predictions per configuration.
- Tell apart the two things a penalty can do to a blocked feature set - shrink the members of a
  family towards each other, or select one member and zero the rest - and read from the results
  which one this data rewards.
- Recognise when a high information coefficient is an artifact of a model that scored fewer
  dates than its neighbours, and use prediction coverage to rule it out.
- Run the same grid on two prediction horizons and read what changes between them.
- Run configurations of your own into a private copy of the run log, and have them compared on
  the same footing as the ones shipped here.

**Book reference**: Chapter 11 (The ML Pipeline). Chapter 6, Section 6.7 (Search accounting and
run logging) introduces the run log this notebook writes to.

**Prerequisites**: [`03_financial_features`](03_financial_features.ipynb) and
[`04_model_based_features`](04_model_based_features.ipynb) have written the feature matrices,
and [`05_evaluation`](05_evaluation.ipynb) has established the walk-forward folds.

**What it writes**: one training run and one complete validation prediction set per
configuration, in `run_log/registry.db` and under `run_log/training/` and
`run_log/predictions/`, grouped under a named population.
[`13_backtest`](13_backtest.ipynb) reads that population, runs every member against the
equal-weight baseline, and selects on validation backtest Sharpe. **Selection happens there,
not here.** This notebook ranks configurations by information coefficient to show what
regularization does to a blocked feature set; that ranking decides nothing.
