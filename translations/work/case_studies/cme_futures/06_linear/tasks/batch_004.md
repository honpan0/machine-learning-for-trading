**A default that is a real hash only means something where a population of that name already
exists**, and two ordinary situations reach this cell where one does not. `run_log/` is not in
the repository, so a reader running this notebook from a fresh checkout is writing the first
version of its population; and a run narrowed under a `POPULATION_NAME` of the caller's choosing,
which the worked example below does, is the first version of that name whatever the built-in
default says. In both, a hash passed here is refused by `OfficialPopulation.create` as a first
version that cannot supersede anything, before any fit happens. `population_supersedes` drops it in
exactly those two cases and in a preview, where a population is discarded with its workspace and
has no lineage to extend.

What it does not do is second-guess a disagreement. A hash naming neither the generation in force
nor the one that generation superseded describes no state this registry is in, so it is withheld
and `OfficialPopulation.create` refuses the changed population with a message naming the snapshot
it requires. The refusal is the registry's to make; withholding is how it is left to it.

**The tier is decided here rather than inside the helper.** `population_supersedes` reads
`study.root`, and a preview in a maintainer worktree does not get its own root: `open_study`
links the generated directories in place and redirects only the writes, so the lookup finds the
canonical generation and hands back a real hash. `run_model_population` then refuses a preview
carrying one, and the preview dies before it fits anything. Withholding the declaration outside
the tier that can use it is what keeps that path runnable.

原文如下（只翻譯原文區）：

`reused` is not zero on a second run. Every identity is re-derived from the inputs, the
registry already holds the matching rows, and the runner returns the stored result rather than
fitting again - so re-running this notebook unchanged costs the time it takes to read the data.

### Running configurations of your own

The published run log is read-only. To add runs, open the study against a workspace, which
holds its own registry and artifacts and reads the same labels and features:

```python
study = open_study("cme_futures", workspace="~/ml4t-experiments")
configs = load_model_configs(
    study, "linear", labels=["fwd_ret_5d"], config_names=["ols", "ridge_a1.0", "ridge_a3.0"]
)
requests = model_requests(study, configs)
resolved = tuple(request.resolve() for request in requests)
execution, population = run_model_population(study, resolved, population_name="my-linear-v1")
```

`CONFIG_NAMES` fits a subset of what the menu already declares; a name the menu does not
declare raises rather than quietly fitting fewer models than you asked for. To fit something
new, add a preset at `case_studies/config/ridge/ridge_a3.0.yaml` and list `ridge_a3.0` under
`linear:` in the label's menu. Editing an existing preset changes that configuration's
identity, so its result registers as a new row beside the old one instead of replacing it.

原文如下（只翻譯原文區）：

Give the run its own `population_name`: a name refers to one set of members permanently, and
reusing it for a different set raises. Everything downstream reads the registry rather than the
notebook, so predictions produced this way are selected and backtested on the same footing as
the ones shipped here, inside your workspace.
[`RUN_LOG.md`](../RUN_LOG.md#running-your-own-configurations) covers the rest, including how to
rehearse on a reduced universe first.
