Re-running this notebook unchanged costs the time it takes to read the data. Every identity is
re-derived from the inputs, the registry already holds the matching rows, and the runner returns
the stored result rather than fitting again.

### Running configurations of your own

The published run log is read-only. To add runs, open the study against a workspace, which holds
its own registry and artifacts and reads the same labels and features:

```python
study = open_study("cme_futures", workspace="~/ml4t-experiments")
configs = load_model_configs(
    study, "gbm", labels=["fwd_ret_5d"], config_names=["leaves_15_huber", "leaves_31_huber"]
)
requests = model_requests(study, configs)
resolved = tuple(request.resolve() for request in requests)
execution, population = run_model_population(study, resolved, population_name="my-gbm-v1")
```

`CONFIG_NAMES` fits a subset of what the menu declares. To fit something new, add a preset at
`case_studies/config/lgb/leaves_127_huber.yaml` and list `leaves_127_huber` under `gbm:` in the
label's menu. Editing an existing preset changes that configuration's identity, so its result
registers as a new row beside the old one rather than replacing it.
[`RUN_LOG.md`](../RUN_LOG.md#running-your-own-configurations) covers the rest.

## 4. What came out

One row per configuration and checkpoint. `ic_mean` is the **information coefficient**: on each
validation date, rank the products by the model's prediction, rank them by the return they went
on to earn, correlate the two rankings, and average that daily correlation over the validation
period.

The table is sorted by label and then by IC, and the top of each label's block is the trap this
notebook exists to describe. The leading row for a label is the maximum of 150 numbers - fifteen
configurations at ten checkpoints each. Reading it as the result of one experiment would
attribute to the model whatever the stopping point contributed, and the section below measures
how large that contribution is before anything is concluded from the ranking.

Coverage is judged against each label's own maximum number of scorable validation dates. The
horizons do not offer the same number to begin with, since a longer forward window runs out
earlier, so one global maximum would mark a whole label incomplete for a reason unrelated to any
model.

### What more trees do

Each line traces one configuration's out-of-sample IC as trees are added to it. This is the
figure the checkpoint dimension exists to produce, and it separates two things a single
end-of-training number cannot.

A line that rises and then falls has an interior optimum: the model was still learning, then
began fitting the training window at the expense of the validation folds. A line that wanders
without trend around zero never had anything to learn in the first place, and its highest point
is wherever the noise happened to peak. The difference matters, because both produce a
respectable-looking maximum.

Whether the lines trend, and which way, is not something to read off a page of overlapping
curves. The frame below measures it: for each configuration, its IC at the last checkpoint
minus its IC at the first, and whether its best checkpoint is an interior one rather than
either end. A family that is still learning would show positive changes and interior peaks; a
family that is overfitting would show negative changes; a family with nothing to learn would
show changes centred on zero with peaks scattered anywhere.

### Comparing every configuration at the same training length

The curves are coloured by objective because that is the axis with a mechanism behind it. If
heavy tails are steering the squared-error fits, the three colours should separate, and they
should separate more as trees are added, since each additional tree is fitted to the residuals
the previous ones left.

The chart below drops the checkpoint dimension by taking each configuration's final state, so
every configuration is compared at the same amount of training. That is the comparison that does
not require choosing anything after the fact. The configurations are held in one order across
the panels - their ranking on the primary label - so a panel that does not descend is a horizon
that orders the grid differently.

### Whether the horizon does here what it did to the linear grid

The question this notebook took from `06_linear`, answered at the same training length for
every configuration. There the best full-coverage IC and the count above zero both rose sharply
with the horizon, and every configuration that cleared zero was an L1 fit; the frame below says
whether a tree ensemble reproduces that.
